## 📌 Project Overview
This repository utilizes **GitHub Pages** and the **Jekyll** static site generator to host long-form economic analysis. By combining Markdown with LaTeX support, I provide clear and accessible breakdowns of complex financial and geopolitical topics.

### Research Pillars
* **Global Macroeconomics:** Tracking growth, debt, and inflation across emerging and advanced economies.
* **Geopolitical Economy:** Analyzing how international relations and energy markets (specifically oil reserves) impact global stability.
* **Technological & Social Shifts:** Evaluating the economic implications of AI, automation, and large-scale migration.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `_posts/`: Contains the primary articles and reviews in Markdown format.
* `_config.yml`: The configuration file for the site theme and metadata.
* `index.md`: The landing page for the published website.
