The global economy today is showing modest growth, but not all countries are benefiting equally. While advanced economies have largely bounced back from the COVID-19 shock, many developing nations are still struggling to recover. The result is a growing economic divide between rich and poor countries—one that threatens the progress of the last few decades and could have serious implications for global stability and shared prosperity.

According to the World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects report, the world economy is expected to grow by about 2.6–2.7% in 2026, a modest pace that reflects both resilience and deep structural challenges. However, nearly all advanced economies have restored per-capita incomes above their pre-pandemic levels, while roughly one in four developing economies remains poorer than in 2019, before COVID-19 struck. This divergence highlights how uneven the recovery has been around the world. 

At the heart of this widening gap are differences in growth rates and economic opportunities. While developed countries have access to stronger fiscal support, advanced technology, and global capital flows, many developing economies face weaker investment, high debt burdens, and slower export growth. Growth in developing countries is projected to slow from about 4.2% in 2025 to 4.0% in 2026, and even with modest gains expected beyond that, the pace remains insufficient to bridge the income divide. Per-capita income growth in these economies is forecast at only about 3% in 2026, roughly one percentage point below its long-term average, meaning that living standards will continue to lag far behind those in rich countries. 

This gap appears even more stark when we consider how long it may take for many developing nations to return to their pre-pandemic growth paths. Absent significant reforms and investment, it could take two decades or more for many economies to make up the ground lost during the sustained slow growth of the 2020s. That slowdown marks a reversal from earlier decades when developing countries made rapid progress, and it has important implications for poverty reduction, job creation, and human development. 

The widening economic divide is not just about GDP numbers—it has real consequences for people’s lives. Uneven recovery means that developing countries struggle to provide quality education, healthcare, and infrastructure for their citizens. Slow growth also limits governments’ ability to invest in climate adaptation and clean energy transitions, making these nations more vulnerable to environmental shocks. In contrast, richer countries have more fiscal space to cushion downturns and invest in future-oriented sectors such as digital technology and renewable energy, which can further accelerate their long-term growth.

Several factors help explain why this gap persists. Many developing countries rely heavily on commodity exports, which expose them to volatile global prices and trade disruptions. Structural issues such as weaker institutions, limited access to finance, and lower levels of technology adoption also slow progress. Meanwhile, advanced economies benefit from stronger institutions, greater technological capabilities, and deeper financial markets that can attract global capital even in periods of uncertainty.

Some analysts worry that new technologies, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), could further widen the gap. A United Nations report warns that without deliberate policies to democratize access and build human capital, AI could deepen the economic divide between rich and poor nations, reversing decades of progress toward convergence. 

Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for narrowing the gap—if countries act strategically. Policy reforms that improve the investment climate, strengthen education and digital infrastructure, and promote inclusive growth could help developing economies unlock faster, more sustainable development. Global cooperation on trade, technology transfer, and climate finance can also support poorer countries in overcoming structural hurdles that limit their growth potential.

Looking ahead, whether the economic gap shrinks or widens will depend on policy choices at both national and global levels. Sustainable and inclusive growth requires not just economic expansion but also investments in human capital, innovation, and good governance. If developing countries can implement structural reforms and attract responsible investment, they may be better positioned to close the gap with wealthy nations over time. However, without decisive action, the growing divide could become one of the most defining challenges of the 21st century, with deep implications for global inequality, migration, and geopolitical stability.
